## General server info

Here's a list of most things you need to know, like changes from plugins and datapacks:
- To edit armor stands you can either use **Armor Stand Editor** (click on one with flint in your hand) or the **Armor Poser** mod.
- You can **create shops** using Universal Shops, you can view a tutorial [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/shoptutorial/).
- Discord chat is linked to the in-game chat, through the #in-game-chat channel, so you can talk in-game and have it appear in discord, and the other way around.
- Player sleep percentage is set to 10%.
- There are a few crafting changes, which are all listed [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/craftingrecipes/).
- **PvP** is disabled by default, but if you want to opt in to PvP then you can do so using the **/pvp** command.
- **Powered rails** will make minecarts go much faster when placed above **packed ice**, and even faster when placed above **blue ice**. **Obsidian** will slow them down.
- **Proximity voice chat** is available (java only), using the [Simple Voice Chat]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/proximitychat/) mod. Also, talking in voice chat will activate sculk sensors.
- There are multiple **custom music discs**, see if you can collect them all!
- **Mini blocks** can be obtained using the stonecutter.

## Gold Farm Guidelines
- Raysworks design is not allowed.
- Donut designs are allowed, as long as they have a direct line to the centre from any part of the donut.
- Look at newer designs, ideally want to avoid designs that involve too much pathfinding. Instead, look for designs that give piglins multiple paths to where they need to go.
- Jam can review any designs that are being considered.
