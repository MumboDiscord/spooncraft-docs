## General Server Info

Here's a list of most things you need to know, like changes from plugins and datapacks:
- You can use flint with an **armor stand** to edit it (right click away from it to change settings, right click on it to apply).
- You can **create shops** using the shopkeepers plugin, you can view a tutorial [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/shoptutorial/).
- Discord chat is linked to the ingame chat, through the [#in-game-chat](https://discord.com/channels/377946908783673344/930585547842404372) channel, so you can talk ingame and have it appear in discord, and the other way around.
- We have a **one player sleep** plugin, which will speed up the night when one person is sleeping, and speed it up more for each person who sleeps at the same time.
- You can create nether portals of **any shape**, instead of just rectangular ones.
- There are a few crafting changes, including **double stairs, cheaper tnt, universal dyeing and elytra crafting** (recipe pinned in [#in-game-help](https://discord.com/channels/377946908783673344/930371836896751618)).  Alternatively, you can also get elytra by killing the dragon again and of course the normal way.
- **PvP** is disabled by default, but if you want to opt in to PvP then you can do so via the reaction roles in [#server-info](https://discord.com/channels/377946908783673344/930371836896751618).
- Powered rails are now much faster when placed above **packed ice**, and even faster when placed above **blue ice**.

## Gold Farm Guidelines
- Raysworks design is not allowed
- Donut designs are allowed, as long as they have a direct line to the center from any part of the donut
- Look at newer designs, ideally want to avoid designs that involve too much pathfinding. Instead, look for designs that give piglins multiple paths to where they need to go
- Jam can review any designs that are being considered
