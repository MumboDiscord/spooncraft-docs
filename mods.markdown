Some mods are allowed on Spooncraft; however we do not allow mods that give you an unfair advantage over other players.

If you are not sure about anything or have any questions, please ask in **#in-game-help** on discord and someone will be happy to help you.

## Allowed mods

This is not an exhaustive list, but is designed to give you an idea of what we would allow or not allow.

### Optimisation mods
Mods that have the goal of improving the performance of your game are generally allowed.

Some examples of these include [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) and [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/home).

Mods designed to improve the speed of launching the game are also of course okay, for example [LazyDFU](https://modrinth.com/mod/lazydfu).

### Cosmetic mods
Mods that are only designed to change the look of the game and do not affect anything else are fine, for example [Slight GUI Modifications](https://modrinth.com/mod/slight-gui-modifications), [Chat Heads](https://modrinth.com/mod/chat-heads) and [Blur](https://modrinth.com/mod/blur-fabric).

This also includes mods that show you information already available elsewhere, such as [MiniHUD](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minihud), which is a customisable display showing the same information visible by pressing F3 in vanilla.

Shader mods such as [Iris](https://irisshaders.net/) and [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/home) are also allowed.

### Minimaps
Minimaps such as [Xaero's Minimap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-minimap/) are allowed, considering that an online map is available to all players anyway.

However, you must turn off any features that allow you to see mobs or caves on the map. For example, in Xaero's Minimap you would press Y, go to Entity Radar Settings, and set Display Radar to off. Then, go to Block Map Settings and set Cave Mode to off.

### Other mods
[Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica) is a mod that allows you to show schematics visually in-game, to help with building. This is allowed as long as there is no automation - the player should still have to build manually.

[Replay Mod](https://www.replaymod.com/download/) allows you to record gameplay and watch it back later as if you were in spectator mode and make videos from it. This is considered fine since you cannot move around in a spectator view while playing, only afterwards.

[Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/mod/simple-voice-chat) allows for in-game proximity voice chat with other players.

## Disallowed mods

Any mod that provides you with information impossible to get while playing on a vanilla client, or any mod that tweaks gameplay in any way will definitely not be allowed.
