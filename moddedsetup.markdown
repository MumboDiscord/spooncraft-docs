A step by step guide on installing the pack for the Modded Miniseason.

### 1. Install Prism Launcher

Go to the Prism Launcher site [here](https://prismlauncher.org/download/) and download the version for your operating system. If you get a popup from SmartScreen when opening the installer, click "More info", then "Run Anyway".

### 2. Set up Prism Launcher

When you first open the launcher, it'll first ask you to select a language, then select your java version. It is important that you select version 17. If it isn't there, install it from [here](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin17-binaries/releases/download/jdk-17.0.11%2B9/OpenJDK17U-jdk_x64_windows_hotspot_17.0.11_9.msi). 

Then, click the Refresh button in the bottom left and it should appear. Make sure it is selected and then click next.

### 3. Log in

Click "Accounts" in the top right of the launcher, then "Manage Accounts...". Select "Add Microsoft" in the top left of the window that appears and follow the instructions to add your Minecraft account. Once you see your username in the list of accounts, you can close the settings window.

### 3. Installing the modpack

Click "Add Instance" in the top left of the launcher, then go to "Import" on the left. Then, paste in `https://mumbodiscord.github.io/spoonpack/Spoonpack.zip` and click OK at the bottom.
