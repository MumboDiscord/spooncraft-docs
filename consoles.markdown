## Troubleshooting

If you're still unable to connect after following these steps, you can try the suggestions below.

- Restart your console and try again.
- Go back to the Minecraft title screen, enable and then disable local mode by pressing **Y**, and try connecting again after it shows a number next to ping on the server list.
- Repeat the instructions again, but use `173.82.100.84` as the Primary DNS instead.
- If you have a mobile device you can use, reset your console's network settings, download [this Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smokiem.mcserverconnector) or [this iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/bedrocktogether/id1534593376), enter the server IP and port, and join the server from friends on your console.
